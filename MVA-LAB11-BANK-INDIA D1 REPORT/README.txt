This folder contains
-  the project’s dataset named application_data.csv 
- a description of each variable of the dataset columns_description.csv (done by the author, but we want to do our own)
- the pdf answering the questions D1.pdf,
- and the R markdown that generated the pdf, D1.Rmd. 

Comment: Although the dataset is very large, with 307,511 rows, we could address it by either filtering some rows or randomly sampling a portion of it. It also has a significant number of variables. What we believe is that having many variables to analyze is better because it allows us to choose the most significant ones or the least significant ones for our analysis. Let us know if this is a good DB to work on.
