- MCA
- Little's test for categorical variables
- We think younger clients tend to have more children. How can we test it?




don't include id in the analysis
put occupation and job_type as extra information (they have too many levels)
a lot of married people (keep it)
put house as extra information (it's too centered on apartment)
join levels other_a and other_b
also with industry, trade and... (higher education:incomplete and lower)
use burt table
mca: analysis only with 2 or 3 dimensions
compare pca and mca centroids

all levels should have different names (even between different variables)

on PCA plot modalities on top of individuals, which are colored by their target modality
