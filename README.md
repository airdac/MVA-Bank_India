Master's team project where we have been asked to analyze the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mishra5001/credit-card. This dataset has been created by IIIT Bangalore, the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore. The project consists in preprocessing the data and afterwards applying the multivariate analysis techniques learnt in the subject. The final goal is to predict whether a client will pay a loan in time or not.
